                I have loved travelling since I can first remember. I have been to over a dozen differnt contries in all four 
                hemispheres. Learning about a local culture, site seeing, and just unwinding are some of the best things about traveeling.
                My wife and I will save up most of the year to splurge for just a couple weeks. Every trip brings a different experience.

                    I can honestly say that I have been brainwashed. Each Saturday in the fall, you can find me glued to the 
                    tv. Some of my favorite memories growing up are going to the stadium with my dad. Ndamokung Suh still is 
                    the best player I have ever seen.

                    I am the luckiest guy on Earth. I have a very loving wife and the best little boy ever. Colin and Jade are my rock. 
                    I have a more friends than I can keep track of and I live free everyday. Spending time with my family is good enough 
                    for this simple guy.

                    For he past 10 years, 8 years I have served in a management role. While I have good experience, I am truly tired of this extra 
                    grind. I no longer feel the challenge is worth the money and is a big role in why I started back in school and eventually focusing
                    on Software engineering. Some of the keys I have learned from managing employees include: documentation, punctual, and building
                    personal relationship with employees.

                        I have been working for DHHS, for the past 5 years, doing social work. Throughout my tenure, I saw and lead a team through
                        a pandemic, Expansion Medicaid, as well as a 100 year old flood. Working with families to help seek assistance made me want 
                        to start with the state. This work has led me to the person I am today and will always be thankful for my time.

                        Working at a local bank and becoming a branch manager served this experience well. I took financing courses at school,
                        as well as, UNL. Helping people plan for whatever their goals may be, fits right with my math skills. Charting milestones
                        reaching those milestone, and eventually circling back with clientele and seeing their enjoyment are why I started with 
                        bank.
